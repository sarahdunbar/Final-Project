## Choose Your Own Adventure Game

Introduction: Set in a fantasy world, this game uses a combination of actions, stats, and a turn counter to 
determine the user's fate. It is structured as an open adventure where the user can type their action, such as 
"open" or "n". The final version is available on runpython, within this document, and is entirely text based.

Commands/Turncounter: This program functions through keyboard input. The commands are as follows:
* n - north (-)
* e - east (-)
* s - south (-)
* w - west (-)
* u - up (-)
* d - down (-)
* l - look 
* i - inventory
* drop - drop object (-)
* grab - grab object (-)
* open - open object (-)

Any object may be operated on by the user, regardless of how unhelpful it is. If the user does not enter a 
correct command, the program will prompt them to do so. 
In addition, the program employs a turn counter, with the player having 40 turns to complete the game.
. Some actions require turns, and some do not. The ones requiring
turns have a (-) beside them. If the object is incorrect for drop, grab, or open, the turncounter will not reduce 
a turn. If the user enters an invalid command, the turncounter will also not cost a turn.

Extra Resources: As this game heavily relies on rooms and directions, a map will be provided to the user
so they do not get confused. No other resources are used.
